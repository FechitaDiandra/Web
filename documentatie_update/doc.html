  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
  <h2>Product Scope</h2>
  <p>The project aims to develop a web application that allows users to create custom forms for statistics and analysis. These forms can be tailored to specific entities or categories, enabling users to gather feedback and generate insights for their own purposes. The forms will capture feedback responses using the Plutchik emotion model.</p>
  <p>In addition to creating forms, the web application will provide users with the ability to provide anonymous feedback for different entities (events, people, locations, products, services, etc.) using the Plutchik emotion model. Users will utilize intuitive forms to submit their emotional responses, which will be recorded and stored using a REST/GraphQL API.</p>

    <h1>6. Architecture</h1>

    <article>
      <h2>6.1 MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture</h2>

      <p>The project follows the MVC architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase. MVC divides an application into three interconnected components:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Model:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Represents the application's data and business logic.</li>
            <li>Interacts with the database, sends requests to the services and encapsulates data manipulation and validation.</li>
            <li>Example: The <code>User</code>, <code>Form</code>, and <code>Answer</code> models manage respective entities and their relationships.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>View:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Presents the user interface and renders data from the model into a suitable format.</li>
            <li>Receives user input and sends it to the controller for processing.</li>
            <li>Example: HTML templates render forms, feedback responses, and statistical data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Controller:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Acts as an intermediary between the model and view.</li>
            <li>Processes user requests, retrieves data from the model, and selects views to display the response.</li>
            <li>Example: PHP controllers handle HTTP requests, invoke appropriate models for data operations, and manage user authentication.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </article>

      <h2>6.2 Services</h2>

      <p>Services in the project encapsulate reusable business logic and external integrations, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>User Service:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Manages user-related operations such as authentication, registration, and profile management.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Form Service:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Handles operations related to form creation, publication, and feedback collection.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Answer Service:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Handles operations related to answers, such as creation, retrieving and generating statistics..</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
